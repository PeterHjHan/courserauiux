# UI UX from coursera

### User Interface
* def: the **interaction** needed from the user to get to a **content**
* **THE SCREEN** is the main interface for users and is the most highly important aspect and deciding factor on deciding the UI and UX design
* the interface shapes the experience
* looks and visual design

UI | UX
--- | ---
form | feel
aesthetics | navigation
look & feel | story
organization | structure
surface | content
visual identity | engagement
design driven | user driven

* different ways to approach which one to design first, the ux or ui, 
    * mostly it is the UI because this is the first thing that the users see before experiencing the content 
* a UI designer is usually given a task on what things need to be shown, thus must think plan and design what is the optimal for the set of rules and needs by the product manager
* The most successful website are *content-specific*, i.e. the design is derived from the content, organized and presented in a way that makes sense to the user
* ideation/planning, front end(UI), back end(coding) and testing(UX) provide the core for developing UI/UX
* components to a website's business = content developer (text, photographs), production, UI design, ideation, UX design, coding, marketing, testing, upkeep & update
    * it is very difficult for one person to do all this but a combination of these components is a huge asset
* Planning Part
    1. There can be sub-interface components of the main interface and must count all the details of it
        * i.e. a bank atm interface requires the user to enter their password to log in and then which service to use, then the amount depending on the service. 
        * Each interaction with an interface requires a form of **feedback**, clicking a number on a number pad should do something to let the user know that a number was clicked.
        * **THINK** how a user could interact with a certain interface and does it require additional buttons to counteract these specific interactions (i.e a delete button for making mistakes)
#### Interface Convetions: Theory
1. Real world knowledge
    * recognize digital buttons of the same style and interface because we have experienced them in our ANALOGS (i.e. the outline of a calculator digitally is same as the ones we use physically)
2. learned behavior
    * Since we learned from the real world, we expect the same results
3. Cause and effect
    * action and reaction
4. Consistency
    * logic/systematic
    * if a button looks the same to another button, they should react in a similar way
5. Seamless
    * speed and ease, **IMMEDAITE** results; no unnecessary steps
6. Immediate intuition
    * know this button and know all the buttons
7. Fulfillment
    * payoff/results; some sort of gratification when an action is fulfilled
8. Undo/Redo
    * Sense of security and no sense of worry when doing interactions

### Image Making Techniques
  * Denotative images
      * literally it is what it is, an image of an apple is an apple
      * What is the essence of this object? i.e. what characteristics convey that the image is an image of it, nothing more, nothing less
  * Connotative image
