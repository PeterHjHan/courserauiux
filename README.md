# UI UX from coursera

### User Interface
* def: the **interaction** needed from the user to get to a **content**
* **THE SCREEN** is the main interface for users and is the most highly important aspect and deciding factor on deciding the UI and UX design
    * depending on the type, the distance between the screen and our body can change
    * phones, tablets, VR, televisions, computers (you do not put the screen of the monitor in one hand an interact with it like a cellphone)
* the interface shapes the experience
* looks and visual design

UI | UX
--- | ---
form | feel
aesthetics | navigation
look & feel | story
organization | structure
surface | content
visual identity | engagement
design driven | user driven

* different ways to approach which one to design first, the ux or ui, 
    * mostly it is the UI because this is the first thing that the users see before experiencing the content 
* a UI designer is usually given a task on what things need to be shown, thus must think plan and design what is the optimal for the set of rules and needs by the product manager
* The most successful website are *content-specific*, i.e. the design is derived from the content, organized and presented in a way that makes sense to the user
* ideation/planning, front end(UI), back end(coding) and testing(UX) provide the core for developing UI/UX
* components to a website's business = content developer (text, photographs), production, UI design, ideation, UX design, coding, marketing, testing, upkeep & update
    * it is very difficult for one person to do all this but a combination of these components is a huge asset
* Planning Part
    1. There can be sub-interface components of the main interface and must count all the details of it
        * i.e. a bank atm interface requires the user to enter their password to log in and then which service to use, then the amount depending on the service. 
        * Each interaction with an interface requires a form of **feedback**, clicking a number on a number pad should do something to let the user know that a number was clicked.
        * **THINK** how a user could interact with a certain interface and does it require additional buttons to counteract these specific interactions (i.e a delete button for making mistakes)
#### Interface Convetions: Theory
1. Real world knowledge
    * recognize digital buttons of the same style and interface because we have experienced them in our ANALOGS (i.e. the outline of a calculator digitally is same as the ones we use physically)
2. learned behavior
    * Since we learned from the real world, we expect the same results
3. Cause and effect
    * action and reaction
4. Consistency
    * logic/systematic
    * if a button looks the same to another button, they should react in a similar way
5. Seamless
    * speed and ease, **IMMEDAITE** results; no unnecessary steps
6. Immediate intuition
    * know this button and know all the buttons
7. Fulfillment
    * payoff/results; some sort of gratification when an action is fulfilled
8. Undo/Redo
    * Sense of security and no sense of worry when doing interactions

#### Interface Conventions: Application
* Organization and arrangement is very important
    * i.e. think of a calculator where the numbers are reorganized in the shape of a diamond (not so good)
* Consider which **physical body part** interacts with the digital screen. 
    * Is it the finger (touchsreens) or is it the mouse?
* Knowing the details of the physical convention will greatly help with desiging the digital conventions
* Due to the history of the website designs, the navigations are now always at the top of the page
* a search input textfield can be simply displayed with a magnifying glass icon
* These are considered as *invisible* conventions. Users are already accustomed to the norm and basic design and layout of various websites (This is the standard form of a website)

#### 4 Golden Rules of UI Design
1. Place users in control of the interface
    * option to undo/redo (be forgiving)
    * Create an easy-to-navigate interface
        * provide Visual cues (i.e. a status bar, or a loading line, form submission)
        * predictability
    * confirm upload of a file 
    * accodmate users with different skill levels
        * provide content for a novice to an expert (range of skills)

2. Make it comfortable for a user to interact with a product
    * Eliminate all elements that are not helping your users
    * Don't make users re-enter previously submitted data
    * Don't make users get annoyed
    * Use easy language
    * Apply Fitt's Law to interactive elements
        * Higher hierarchy buttons should stand out more 
    * Think about accessibility of the users (i.e. color blind people)
    * Use real world metaphors (use a garbage icon for trashing a file)
    * Represent errors with precise, polite and constructive messages
    * BEST design is to eliminate the error before it is actually happening
    * **NOTE**: think about all the errors that a user can do while interacting and see if those can be automatically avoided by the system (less work for the human is always better)
    * Protect User's work

3. Reduce cognitive load
    * def: amount of mental processing power required to use a product
    * Chunking for sequences of information or actions
        * the human brain acts by looking at information in chunks instead long string
        * for example, viewing a phone number is best in the form of 123-456-7890 instead of 1234567890
    * Recognition over recall
        * Promote recognition over recall 
        * Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions and options visible 
        * i.e. a message underneath a muted microphone indicating the microphone is muted 

4. Make user interfaces consistent
    * Don't give existing terms new meanings and interactions
    * a button should have the same interaction with other buttons
    * Think about the level of interaction required from the user 

#### Approaches to UI design
1. Template
  * Follows the same convention of existing website
  * Provides predictability but not exicting because users know what's where and what's going to happen
  * One size does not fit all
  * Customization is required depending on the content of the website

2. Context
  * Does not follow the same convention of existing websites
  * Think of the content first and see what is the best website to build
  * Requires the balance of generic and the user experience depending on the specificality of the user of th website
  * A good website puts the aesthetics and functionality in a very well balanced matter

#### Aesthetics and Functionality
  * Aesthetics is often connected with the content (HOW IT LOOKS)
    * CSS (i.e. border color, border-radius)
  * Functionality of the user interface (HOW IT WORKS)
    * it's the :hover, $().click(function());
  * **Successful user interface** is created when both Aesthetics and Funcionality have no differences and work in cohesion for the same thing
        

### Image Making Techniques
  * Denotative images
      * literally it is what it is, an image of an apple is an apple
      * What is the essence of this object? i.e. what characteristics convey that the image is an image of it, nothing more, nothing less
  * Connotative image
